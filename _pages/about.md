## Bio
<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://minghsiehee.usc.edu/">ECE department</a> at at <a href="http://www.usc.edu">University of Southern California</a>. I am fortunate to work with <a href="https://govindan.usc.edu/">Prof. Ramesh Govindan</a> and <a href="https://raghavan.usc.edu/">Prof. Barath Raghavan</a> in <a href="http://nsl.cs.usc.edu/">Networked System Lab (NSL)</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to joining USC, I received my B.S. degree in EECS and B.A. degree in Economics from <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>.</p>

<p>I am interested in Computer Networking and System research including software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and high-performance cloud/edge computing. I enjoy building large-scale, high-throughput and low-latency computing systems, especially for packet-processing systems.</p>

<p>I've built <b>Lemur</b>, a high-throuhgput NFV cross-platform compiler; <b>Quadrant</b>, a cloud-deployable NFV platform with an efficient isolation mechanism; <b>Ironside</b>, a cluster scheduler that provides latency guarantees for NFV; <b>PGPP</b>, a privacy-preserving proxy for Android device (available at Google Play Store). This <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pretty-good-phone-privacy-android/">Wired report</a> describes what PGPP can do (e.g., hiding your IP address when using Internet services).</p>
